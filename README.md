# Codecool-Shop
Codecool shop is a simulation of an online shopping store. 

The site features an account creation and login system, this allows you to save and load the shopping cart. Items can be added to the shopping cart and the user can go through a mock checkout system. The site was constructed in two sprints each lasting one week and this was the MVP we managed to deliver in that time. The data for the website is stored in a SQL Server database which is filled with randomly generated items for the shop.
